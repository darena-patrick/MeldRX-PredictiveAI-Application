## üöÄ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JonathanSolvesProblems/MeldRX-PredictiveAI-Application.git
cd predictive-ai-service
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHORITY=https://app.meldrx.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID=<meldrx client id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/callback
GEMINI_API_KEY=<Google Gemini API Key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID=<meldrx bundle id>
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ MeldRx App Setup

To integrate with **MeldRx**, follow these steps:

1. **Create an app** on [MeldRx](https://app.meldrx.com/).
2. **Set the required OAuth Scopes** for authentication:
   - `profile`
   - `openid`
   - `launch`
   - `launch/patient`
   - `patient/*.*`
   - `patient/*.read`
3. **Configure the Redirect URL:**
   - For the deployed app:
     ```sh
     https://meld-rx-predictive-ai-application.vercel.app/callback
     ```
   - For local development:
     ```sh
     http://localhost:3000/callback
     ```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ CDS Hook Setup

To enable **Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Hooks**, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your **MeldRx App Dashboard**.
2. Locate the **CDS Hooks Configuration** section.
3. Set the **CDS Hook Service URL**:

   - For the deployed app:
     ```sh
     https://meld-rx-predictive-ai-application.vercel.app/api/cds-services/0001
     ```
   - For local development:

     ```sh
     http://localhost:3000/api/cds-services/0001
     ```

     3.1. Ensure to host it with ngrok generated URL and use that as the URL to get it to work without hosting it: [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

4. Save the configuration and ensure your **CDS Hook is active**.
5. The CDS Hook will trigger when a patient record is opened, providing a link to the application for further analysis.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Import Sample Patients

To test the application, you can import sample patient data into MeldRx:

1. **Go to the MeldRx Dashboard** and navigate to the **Patients** section.
2. Look for the option to **Import Sample Patients** and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Once imported, open a sample patient record within the **EHR system**.
4. The CDS Hook should trigger automatically, displaying a link to the **Predictive AI Healthcare Insighter** app.
5. Click the link to access AI-generated insights, including **risk scores, recommended actions, and data visualizations**.

‚úÖ _At this point, the app should be fully functional within the EHR system, displaying AI-driven insights on patient data!_ üöÄ

## üåç Online Deployment

The application is hosted on Vercel at:

üëâ [MeldRx Predictive AI App](https://meld-rx-predictive-ai-application.vercel.app/)

‚ö† **Note**: The hosted URL must be navigated through the MeldRx platform in order to initiate the authentication step to access the application.
